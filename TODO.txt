- Filter only relevant tokens for a particular .y grammar (in generation).
- Extract a "TypeOfExpr" component out of TypeChecker.
- An API for reuse of Bison's action rules (lightweight, inteligible, generic).
- Assemble Python helper scripts into a lib.
- Expand the project to also model an abstract text editor API.

- A bunch of TODOs in the code and incomplete implementations.
